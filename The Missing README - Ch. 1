        "What happens during the 'Ramp-Up River' phase for new engineers?",
        "What is 'Cape Contributor' in the journey of a software engineer?",
        "What challenges are associated with 'Operations Ocean'?",
        "What is 'Competence Cove' in the software engineer's journey?",

        "How do engineers transition from 'Cape Contributor' to 'Competence Cove'?",
        "What mindset is essential for continuous growth as a software engineer?"
    ],
    "Answer": [
        "The first phase is 'Peak Newb,' where new engineers are learning the basics, setting up their environment, and understanding team processes.",
        "'Peak Newb' refers to the initial phase where new engineers are figuring out the basics and still need guidance.",
        "In 'Ramp-Up River,' engineers start learning the codebase, contributing small tasks, and asking questions to understand team workflow.",
        "'Cape Contributor' is when engineers start shipping meaningful features, working more independently, and contributing to code reviews.",
        "'Operations Ocean' involves handling operational challenges such as debugging, dealing with production systems, and learning how to maintain system health.",
        "'Competence Cove' represents the phase where engineers are more independent, lead small projects, and take ownership of technical designs.",
        "Asking questions helps new engineers deepen their understanding of processes and workflows, especially during the 'Ramp-Up River' phase.",
        "The focus during 'Operations Ocean' is on debugging, production system maintenance, and handling operational challenges.",
        "Engineers transition by gaining more independence, taking on more responsibility for projects, and driving technical designs.",
        "A growth mindset, which focuses on continuous learning and improvement, is essential for engineers to grow through each phase."
